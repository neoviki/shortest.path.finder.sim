# Shortest Path Simulation in Processing

This application simulates the shortest path finding algorithm. It is implemented using **Processing**. It is compatible with most operating systems running **Java 8**.

### Requirements

- **Java 8** or later.
- **Processing IDE** (https://processing.org/download/)

### Installation

1. Install **Java 8** on your machine (if you don't already have it installed).
   
   - For **MacOS**:
     - You can download it from the official [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
  
   - For **Windows** and **Linux**: You can use your respective package manager or download it from the same link above.

2. Download the **Processing IDE** from [here](https://processing.org/download/).

3. Clone or download this repository.

4. Open the `src/robot_shortest_path/robot_shortest_path.pde` file in the **Processing IDE**.

### How to Run the Application

#### For macOS:
1. Go to **System Preferences** -> **Security & Privacy**.
2. Select **Allow apps downloaded from anywhere** to ensure the app can run without restrictions.

#### For all other operating systems:
1. Open the **Processing IDE**.
2. Open the `src/robot_shortest_path/robot_shortest_path.pde` file.
3. Press the **Run** button in the Processing IDE (the play icon in the top-left corner).

The simulation will start, and you can visualize the algorithm as it finds the shortest path.
